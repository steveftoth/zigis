## zigis - a Redis server written in zig from scratch


## Project Goals

* Provide a basic implementation of the redis key value store in zig.
* Implement the service so that it can be reused from other processes, the main goal being as a library for use in a postgres plugin
* Clean room implementation based on protocol only. No copying code or porting code from redis C version.
* Learn and have fun!
